/// Implementations must be safe to use from multiple concurrent request scopes and must not retain mutable request state between calls.
/// Provider SDK, HTTP and serialization failures must be normalized to application-level provider exceptions before crossing this boundary.
/// Implementations must throw <see cref="OperationCanceledException" /> only when the supplied cancellation token is canceled; provider timeouts and internal aborts must be reported as provider failures so retry and usage accounting stay deterministic.
/// The returned <see cref="AiModelResponse.Provider" /> value identifies the adapter that produced the response, and <see cref="AiModelResponse.ProposedToolCalls" /> must be empty when the provider did not propose tool calls.
